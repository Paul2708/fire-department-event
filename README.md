# Fire-Department-Event
This software is used to add and manage time-based operations for an event.
The event allows children to simulate one day in a fire department.

The application is written in Java and is based on [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io).

More details will follow soon.

- as JavaFX already follows the MVC, we do not need to implement it ourself
